Welcome to my personal website! I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer & Data Engineer from Slovakia.

My programming journey began in my high school years, when I first learned to code simple applications using [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and building dynamic websites using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [HTML and CSS](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss.html). During my college years my focus has shifted to [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), as there was a high demand for Java Software Engineers at the time and I saw it as perfect way to begin my career in IT.

I've spent most of my years as a Java Software Engineer developing large enterprise applications.
Working for a company that provided custom solutions for [Records Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_management) and
[Information Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_governance) made me realize
how hard it is for a company to correctly catalog huge amounts of data.

I've studied multiple data mining techniques to extract useful information from structured and unstructured sources.
This knowledge allowed me to switch the direction of my career towards Data Engineering and Data Science.

Currently as a member of the Analytics Products team I'm using my whole skillset to support all phases of data product development.
This includes Frontend ([JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/)), Backend ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)) and Data ([Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Databricks](https://databricks.com/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)).
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and use them on my various side-projects.
