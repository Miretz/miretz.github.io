Welcome to my personal website! I'm a senior software engineer, architect and technical lead
in the area of text mining, machine learning and natural language processing.

My IT journey began in my high school years when I started to write simple applications in Delpi and 
websites using PHP. During my college years I shifted my focus to Java, as there was a high
demand for Java programmers at the time and I saw it as perfect way to begin my career in IT.

I've spent most of my years as a Java developer working on complex enterprise applications.
Working for a company that builds and sells [Records Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_management) and
[Information Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_governance) software made me realise 
how hard it is for a company to correctly catalog huge amounts of documents.
Companies lose track of important data in terabytes of various documents processed each day.

I started to study how to mine unstructured data and how to extract valuable information from it.
Understanding this enables companies gain insight into their data and also automate their processing.
Currently I'm part of a team that focuses on these topics and a product owner of our internal text mining platform.

Nowadays my language of choice is Python. It's ideal for small applications and interactive data exploration.
There are also many powerful scientific libraries and a strong community support.
