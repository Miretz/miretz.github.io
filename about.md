Welcome to my personal website! I'm a senior analytics engineer, backend developer, data scientist and a hobby game developer.

My IT journey began in my high school years when I started to write simple applications in Delphi and 
websites using PHP. During my college years I shifted my focus to Java, as there was a high
demand for Java programmers at the time and I saw it as perfect way to begin my career in IT.

I've spent most of my years as a Java developer working on complex enterprise applications.
Working for a company that builds and sells [Records Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_management) and
[Information Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_governance) software made me realize 
how hard it is for a company to correctly catalog huge amounts of documents.
Companies lose track of important data in terabytes of various documents processed each day.

I started to study how to mine unstructured data and how to extract valuable information from it.
Understanding this enables companies gain insight into their data and also automate their processing.

Currently as a member of the analytics team I'm working on both structured and unstructured data.
As a data scientist with software engineering background, I'm involved in every phase of a product's life cycle.

My language of choice is Python. It is ideal for building productive applications and at the same time provides powerful data exploration capabilities. I'm also actively using the R language for statistical data analysis and visualization.
For both of these languages there are many powerful scientific libraries and strong community support.
