I like reading books. Many people find them to be a good source of relaxation and enjoy stories which aim to kindle the childish imagination which is buried deep inside all of us. People might enjoy The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter or The Hunger Games. Books that resonate with a large audience and their fantasy worlds inspired several movies. Mass production of merchandise and advertising makes sure that even those who never read the books or watch the movies know what the story is about.

However, I am a fan of a very different kind of literature. When you think about the typical stories in the current popular bestsellers, you realize that they are mostly one-off experiences. You will enjoy them while reading/watching, finish the consumption of the product and forget about them. The adverts everywhere will eventually make you sick of them.

Why is that? Maybe one of the reasons might be that these books and movies are for the most part meaningless. I don't argue that they are a great way to pass time, but in the long term they are consumable products. There are no parallels, no important life lessons to learn and very little inspiration in them that you could draw into your own life.

## The House of the Dead

I am currently reading [The House of the Dead by Fyodor Dostojevskij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel)). While the name of the book might sound like an old horror video-game, actually this book was written in 1862 and it has nothing to do with the horror genre. The House of the Dead is about the hard life in a prison camp in Siberia. The main protagonist and narrator Aleksandr Petrovich has been sentenced to ten years of hard labour. The book is a deep analysis of life and work, human soul, values and spirit. I'm pretty sure this book changes ones perspective on life after he reads it.

One specific passage resonated a lot with me. It was about the prisoner's point of view on meaningless work. To clarify, the inmates were paid regular money to do all the jobs. It was a smaller amount than in the real world but it was actual money. This work should have been positive for them, judging by their financial situation, but it was not. 

Why is that? Let's imagine filling a bucket and pouring it out and then filling it again. Repeating this over and over. The agony of such work would be far worse than anything else with regards to their life in captivity. Doing repetitive and meaningless work is probably the hardest punishment there is. The inmates rather chose hard work like building roads or mining, because it was not so repetitive and there were actual results which one could be proud of. 

> It once came into my head that if it were desired to reduce a man to nothing—to punish him atrociously, to crush him in such a manner that the most hardened murderer would tremble before such a punishment, and take fright beforehand—it would be necessary to give to his work a character of complete uselessness, even to absurdity.

## Modern corporate work

It is not such a big stretch, if we draw a parallel to the modern corporate work. How many jobs might be meaningless or seem meaningless from the outset. What does this type of work do to us? David Graeber in his book [Bullshit Jobs: A theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) talks a lot about the harm caused by meaningless jobs. He even categorizes the jobs into 5 types:  flunkies, goons, duct tapers, box tickers, and taskmasters. If you want to know more about these types I highly recommend that you read this book. It might even open your eyes and make changes that will eventually make you more happy in your current work.

Meaningless work is one of the biggest reasons why senior staff leaves their current employer. While junior people might be driven by money, the experienced people know that they will not get a huge salary increase if they go somewhere else. They leave their manager or they leave their meaningless job for a job in a fresh new company, interesting startup or start their own business.

So what can we do to retain senior staff and reduce meaningless jobs? It's simple, create meaningful jobs. Why are there so many developers working on Open Source projects? The work they are doing is meaningful and without their contributions a lot of the corporate software would never exist. They have real users and even real customers. Great many people are still doing this hard and demanding job absolutely for free. When the result of your work is internal reward (something to be proud of) it instantly becomes more meaningful (to you and to others).

## The bottom line

The bottom line is that if you want your employees to be happy, give them work which has a meaning. Give them work which is inspiring and which rewards their efforts. Work which is dynamic, open and where they can truly express their creative freedom. Allow them to speak to the clients or customers. Let them do the important choices. Give them responsibility for their own ideas and not just for their manager's ideas.
